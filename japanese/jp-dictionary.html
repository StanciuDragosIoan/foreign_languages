    お可愛いこと (o kawai koto)
 </p>
 <p class="text center">
 *this is translated as 'how cute' but it is condescending. It could also be translated as 'poor thing/poor cute thing'
 </p>
 <p class="text">
     The <span class="snippet">お可愛いこと</span> phrase being used in a manga:
 </p>
 <div class="devPic">
     <img src="./assets/img/o-kawaii-koto-kaguya-sama.webp" alt="">
 </div>
 <p class="text center bold">The cultural background of <span class="snippet">お可愛いこと</span> </p>
 <p class="text">
    The phrase o kawaii koto お可愛いこと can be divided into three parts:
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    o- お～ (prefix)
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    kawaii 可愛い (adjective)
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    koto こと (noun)
 </p>
 <p class="text center bold">
    o- お～ (prefix)
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    The polite o- お～ prefix doesn't really mean anything. It's just polite. The anime takes 
    place in an elite school, with pretentious, elite students. And Kaguya is an ojousama character. 
    So she speaks in this polite and well-educated-sounding way with meaningless polite affixes and stuff.
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    If there's any meaning behind it, it would be that whatever comes after it belongs to someone else.
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    In Japanese, the rule of thumb of politeness is that you humble yourself and exalt others, so honorific prefixes and suffixes 
    generally don't go on your own stuff, only on stuff of other people's.
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    For example, te 手 (kanji) means "hand." But if you're referring to someone else's hand, then maybe you want to refer to it respectfully,
     by adding a completely pointless prefix to it: ote お手, "[your] hand."
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    Similarly, namae 名前 means "name." But often you'll see onamae お名前 as a way to ask for "[your] name."
 </p>
 <p class="text center bold">
    kawaii 可愛い (adjective)
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    The word have kawaii 可愛い, means "cute." It's an i-adjective. And normally there wouldn't be anything to say about it, except that kawaii has a less common second meaning which 
    is actually very relevant in the context of this series: it also means "pitiable."
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    That is, something kawaii is something you can pity, because of how sorry it is. Something that "seems pitiful" is called kawaisou 可愛そう. Nowadays that's spelled kawaisou 可哀想, an ateji, 
    as the kawaii 可愛い spelling is normally associated with appearance rather than pity. 
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    In this way, kawaii, being both cute and pitiful, becomes condescending word, a word that means the speaker is looking down at you, taking pity on your cute attempts at doing things, 
    specially in this series of overly proud characters.
 </p>
 <p class="text center bold">
    koto こと (noun)
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    Lastly, we have koto こと. This last word is extremely complicated, because it's a nominalizer and English doesn't have those. Basically, it's a word that means 
    "thing," but that's almost always qualified by some adjective.
 </p>
 <p class="text">
    That is, you normally don't use koto alone the way you'd use "thing" in English. There's always an adjective before koto. In this case, 
    kawaii koto, a "cute thing." Or: "something that is cute."
